Design a sun synchronous low-earth orbit satellite mission. 
Using appropriate orbital propogation, simulate this mission on MATLAB simulink.
Input the mission parameters into GMAT(should be more accurate) and simulate the same orbit.
Compare the results of our used compuational methods(MATLAB) vs GMAT
Results- How accurate and how computationally effective?
